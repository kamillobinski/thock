# Usage:
#   thock-cli set-mode "oreo" --brand "everglide" --author "mechvibes"

# Define the path to the Thock named pipe
PIPE="$HOME/Library/Application Support/thock/thock.pipe"

# Check if the named pipe exists
if [[ ! -p "$PIPE" ]]; then
  echo "Error: Thock pipe not found at: $PIPE"

# Construct the command to send, wrapping each argument in double quotes
COMMAND=""
for arg in "$@"; do
  # Escape any existing double quotes within the argument

  # Wrap the argument in double quotes and add it to the command string
  COMMAND+="\"$escaped_arg\" "
done

# Trim any trailing whitespace from the final command string
