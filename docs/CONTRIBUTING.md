## Getting Started

Whether it's a small typo fix or a big new feature, contributions are always welcome!

### Small fixes (like typos, cleanup, minor tweaks)

- Open a pull request directly - no need to open an issue first
- Keep the description short and clear

### Large changes or new features

- Open an issue first to discuss your idea before diving in
- This helps avoid duplicated work or things that don't fit the scope
- Once approved, follow these steps:
  1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
  2. Create a new branch for your change (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
  3. Make your changes, then commit and push to your fork (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
  4. Open a pull request to the main repository (remember to link it to the original issue if applicable)

If you are not sure where your change falls, just open an issue to talk it through!

## How to Report a Bug

If you run into a bug, here's the best way to report it so it can be fixed quickly:

1. Check the [issues](https://github.com/kamillobinski/thock/issues) to see if it's already been reported.
2. If not, open a new issue with:
   - A clear title (e.g. "Crash when switching sound mode")
   - A short description of what went wrong
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - MacOS version and any relevant system info
   - A screenshot if that would help

The more detail you give, the easier it is to fix.

## How to Suggest a Feature or Enhancement

Got an idea to make Thock better? Awesome, let's discuss it!

Here's how to go about it:

1. Check [issues](https://github.com/kamillobinski/thock/issues) and [board](https://github.com/kamillobinski/thock/projects?query=is%3Aopen) to see if it's already on the radar.
2. If not, open a new issue with:
   - A short and clear title
   - A description of the feature or enhancement
   - Why it would be helpful or how it improves the experience

## Code Review Process

All code submissions are reviewed before being merged - at the moment that's just me (@kamillobinski ðŸ‘‹).

### How the review process works

- After you open a pull request, I'll take a look when I can
- I may leave comments or request changes if something needs adjusting
- Once everything looks good, I'll approve and merge it

If you don't hear back right away, don't worry - I'll get to it as soon as I can.
Feel free to ping the thread if it's been a while! Don't hesitate haha

## Commit Style

This project follows the [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification â€” but with a simplified set of prefixes.

Please use one of the following when writing commit messages:

- `feat:` â€” A new feature
- `fix:` â€” A bug fix
- `refactor:` â€” Code change that doesnâ€™t add a feature or fix a bug
- `chore:` â€” General maintenance (e.g. project config, dependency bumps)

### Examples:

```sh
feat: add support for custom key mapping
fix: crash when switching sound mode
refactor: simplify event tap logic
chore: update readme with installation steps
```
