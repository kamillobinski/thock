## [What's New](https://github.com/kamillobinski/thock/compare/1.18.1...1.18.2)

> Critical audio stability improvements.

### Bug Fixes

- **Audio Recovery After Sleep/Wake**
  The audio queue now reinitializes automatically, so your sound should be right where you left it.

- **Audio Stopping After Extended Use**
  For those marathon sessions, we finally squashed some nasty thread safety issues and race conditions. This should prevent your audio from just... dying after extended use.

- **Device List Updates**
  Device monitoring now runs continuously, so new gear pops up in your dropdown instantly.

- **Idle Timer Stability**
  Fixed a weird race condition in the idle timeout. This means your audio won't get stuck in limbo, especially if you like those super short timeout settings.

> These fixes tackle some genuinely annoying audio behavior. Give this version a spin and if anything still feels off, an issue on github would be genuinely helpful. The audio engine is tricky, and every bit of insight helps tame it.
