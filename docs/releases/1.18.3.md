## [What's New](https://github.com/kamillobinski/thock/compare/1.18.2...1.18.3)

> More audio stability fixes.

### Bug Fixes

- **Audio Queue Restart Recovery**
  You know how sometimes audio would just... vanish and the app seemed to give up trying to fix it? Not anymore. If something goes wrong with your sound, the app is much smarter about getting it back on track without you having to do anything.

- **Better Device Handling**
  Constantly switching between headphones and speakers or dealing with bluetooth that decides to randomly disconnect? We've made it smoother. Thock is now much better at keeping up with your devices, even when they're playing hard to get.

- **Sleep/Wake Improvements**
  After your mac wakes up, sometimes bluetooth devices are a bit slow to reconnect. Thock now waits a moment longer for everything to catch up, meaning less fuss getting your sound working right away.
