> 你好, こんにちは, hello. Your mouse says hi too.

### New Features

- **Localization Support**
  Thock now speaks your language. Choose between English, Chinese (Simplified), and Japanese in Settings. The entire UI adapts to your selection, making Thock feel right at home no matter where you are. Community contributions welcome for additional languages. @Kaedeeeeeeeeee 🫡

- **Mouse Click Sounds**
  Your mouse deserves some love too. Enable click sounds in Settings → Sound and hear satisfying feedback for every left and right button press. Full support for mouse down and mouse up events, just like keyboard sounds. This is the foundation for upcoming mouse soundpacks from our remote registry. Built on trackpad support by @Kaedeeeeeeeeee 🫡
