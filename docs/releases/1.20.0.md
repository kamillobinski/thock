- **Auto-Enable on Headphone Connection**
  Plug in your headphones and Thock automatically enables. Disconnect and it turns off. Perfect for office workers who want clicky sounds in their ears but not annoying their coworkers. Works with both wired and wireless headphones. Find it in Settings → Sound → Filters. @Kaedeeeeeeeeee 🫡
